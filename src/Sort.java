 * The Law of the Broken Futon
 *
 * You might ask yourself why we spent so much time and space covering what seems like a triviality. This is probably especially true if you have prior Java experience. The reason is that it is very easy for a student to have a half-cocked understanding of this issue, allowing them to write code, but without true comprehension of what's going on.
 *
 * While this might be fine in the short term, in the long term, doing problems without full understanding may doom you to failure later down the line.
